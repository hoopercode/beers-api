# Nology Project - Punk Beer API

This has been a project allocated to me during my 12 Week Nology Course

## Brief

"Your task is to build a website using React based on the specifications outline below. This will 
be based on the Punk API which contains all the data you will need for the task (there is also a 
link to a data file which we recommend you use before diving straight into using the API). 
Please refer to Earworm as well as the sandbox apps we built together during the module!"

### My Learning


- APIs:  This was probably the purpose of the entire task. Being able to access, manipulate and use an API to present data.  I loved this part of the project.  It was really cool being able to see the different ways that you could change your API link to get different results.  From what I can tell, API's can vary quite differently from API to API in regards to what you can add to the end of them.

- Props:  These are properties that we pass down to the APP.jsx that essentially carry data that is going to be used at a later point.  We generally keep the names the same as we pass them through different components.  Prop drilling is when you have to go through multiple levels of components.

- State:  This is how we change how a component or certain thing is behaving on our page.  We use useState to set a default state for an element and then we are able to change it using the setState.  This is a much cleaner way of changing the content/appearance/behavior of an element compared to vanilla JS.

- Routing/Linking  This is how we make the page appear as if it is going somewhere else.  It is a great way of re-using some of our components with different data.

### Things I found difficult

- Params:  This is still something that we are learning about and I didn't manage to get it working.

### Looking Forward

- Params:  Continue learning about this

- BEM:  Continue making sure I am careful with my naming of html elements.  I get slack with this.

- Branching:  Still not good at this, I think setting up branches at the beginning of a project would be helpful.

- Mixins:  I am still using full CSS for media queries.  I need to go away and learn about mixins.
